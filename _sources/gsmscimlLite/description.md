## Class details

### `BoreholeView`

BoreholeView is a simplified view of a GeoSciML Borehole. In GeoSciML terms, this will be an instance of a Borehole feature with key property values summarised as labels (unconstrained character strings) or arbitrarily selected classifiers to be used for thematic mapping purposes. The latter are the properties suffixed with “_uri” and will contain URIs referring to controlled concepts in published vocabularies.
