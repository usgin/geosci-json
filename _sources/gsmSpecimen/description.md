### `Image`

The Image feature type is used to describe images of sampling features, for example, photographs of ion microprobe grain mounts.

### `ReferenceSpecimen`

A reference specimen is a specimen with known or accepted values of some property. The citation property describes the location of a published description of these values. Reference specimens include analytical blanks. ReferenceSpecimens are used in quality control procedures to assess method reproducibility. Analytical results from a reference specimen analysed during an AnalyticalSession are delivered in the same way as the results of other specimens analysed in that session.

### `SF_Specimen`

ISO 19156:2011 §8.6 SF_Specimen — a sampling feature representing a physical specimen collected from a sampled feature. Implementation inlines the SF_SamplingFeature parent's properties (sampledFeature, relatedObservation, relatedSamplingFeature, lineage) since the parent is not separately schematised here. External ISO types referenced from properties (OM_Process, OM_Observation, GFI_Feature, TM_Object, LI_Lineage, SF_SamplingFeature) are by-reference only via SCLinkObject.
